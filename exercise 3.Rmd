### **d) Name 2 strengths and 2 weaknesses of Git.**

**Strengths:**

1.  **Version Control:** Git allows you to track changes over time, revert to previous versions, and work on different branches without affecting the main code.

2.  **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously, and Git provides powerful tools to merge changes and resolve conflicts.

**Weaknesses:**

1.  **Steep Learning Curve:** Beginners can find Git difficult to learn, especially when dealing with merge conflicts or using advanced commands.

2.  **Complex History:** For larger projects, the commit history can become messy and hard to understand if not managed properly.
